General information
-------------------

Innomatic is an open source platform for building multi-tenant cloud
applications in PHP language.

It is suitable as an Internet/Intranet development and deployment
system. It has a very strong modular architecture and allows very fast
deployment of web based solutions.



Features
--------

- Web interface. The first standard Innomatic interface is the web
administration system.

- Web services interface. The container provides a powerful interface for
XmlRpc web services calls.

- Centralized customers/sites administration. Creation, editing and remotion
of the customer profiles/sites can be done through a single interface.

remotion of the applications is done through a single interface.

- Extensibility of container functions. Container functions can be extended
through external applications and hooks.

- Extreme modularity. The whole container is designed with modularity in
mind.

- Interaction between the applications. Every application can interact
with the other applications, through API calls, hooks, web services and other.
The container also provides dependencies support between
applications.

- Immediate installation and update of applications. To install an
application in the container you only need to upload the application
file through a applications administration page. The same applies for the
update of already installed applications.

- Install applications once - use many times. When installing an
application, it can be enabled to all container sites without
reinstalling it.

- Easy installation and immediate update of the container. Since Innomatic
is seen by itself as a deployable application, it has all of applications
properties and can be updated like any other application with a single step.

programmed with a dedicated library of functions; no HTML in code.

domains and without changing the original application code with the override
feature.

abstraction layer. Current available interfaces: PostgreSQL and MySQL.
